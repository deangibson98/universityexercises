# universityexercises
# Hello World!
# I have created a repository containing various different files of code that I have done on my own
# These are partially from Youtube exercises, university quizes and assignments (for my Masters), and general ideas of my own
# I normally try to avoid having comments written in them for them to be as simplistic and easy to read as possible
# please do not hesitate to contact me with any C&C, my email address is dean.gibson@lincoln.ac.nz 
# you can also check out my music project on Spotify & Youtube under the name GIBSON XCVIII
